International remittance involves multiple parties in different geographies. The sender\u2019s bank, the recipient\u2019s bank and various intermediaries are often operating in different countries and currencies, and each will have different systems and processes for handling international transfers. These differences result in a number of issues, including delays or errors due to compliance and regulatory issues, technical issues, time-zone differences, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. International remittances from originators to terminating operators can take up to 20 days if more than two carriers are involved."]}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(n.p,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(n.strong,{children:"USD Forex crunch in emerging markets"})," occurs when there is a shortage of US dollars in the foreign exchange markets of developing countries. This makes it difficult for businesses and individuals to access the currency needed to make international transactions. Various factors, such as a decrease in foreign investment, a decline in exports, or a shift in global market conditions can all cause a shortage of dollars in emerging markets. This can significantly impact the local economy when carriers struggle to pay for the services received from global merchants."]}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(n.p,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(n.strong,{children:"The volatility of local currency against the USD"})," also presents a challenge to carriers, especially in emerging market economies. For example, a carrier can receive revenue in a local currency that experiences a sudden and significant depreciation against the USD. In that case, their earnings may decrease in USD even if their local currency remains constant. This loss in currency value can make planning for investments, expansion, or other business decisions challenging for those operating in emerging markets.  Additionally, the fluctuations in currency exchange rates can also impact the costs of international settlements and remittances. If a carrier is required to convert earnings in a local currency to USD in order to issue payment to their partners, for example, changes in the exchange rate can negatively affect the amount they ultimately receive or payout."]}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(n.p,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(n.strong,{children:"High cost of cross-border transactions"})," is another challenge. Telecom carriers route large volumes of voice traffic across different countries and regions, often exchanging currencies and making cross-border payments. These transactions can be costly due to a variety of factors, including transaction fees, currency conversion charges, and taxes. These expenses can add up quickly and create a significant financial burden on wholesale voice carriers, particularly those operating in emerging markets where the cost of cross-border transactions can be as high as $30-50 USD. While that may not sound like a lot for one transaction, keep in mind that telecom carriers are settling millions of transactions per year."]}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(n.p,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(n.strong,{children:"Low Margins"})," compound these challenges and present a substantial risk to telecom carriers. Telecom carriers provide services to other companies, such as mobile network operators, international carriers, and VoIP service providers. Telecom carriers have to invest in expensive equipment like switches and routers to maintain extensive networks and ensure high-quality services.  SMS margins hover around 10% while telecom voice carrier margins are reduced to 2%. The overall margins for carrier business are between 6-7%. Furthermore, intense competition in the industry, high infrastructure costs, and growing uptake of alternative communication methods are affecting profitability and pushing some carriers to the brink of razor-thin margins."]})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,s.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},8453:(e,n,r)=>{r.d(n,{R:()=>i,x:()=>o});var t=r(6540);const s={},a=t.createContext(s);function i(e){const n=t.useContext(a);return t.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function o(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:i(e.components),t.createElement(a.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
