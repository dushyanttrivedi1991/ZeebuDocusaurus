<h2> Epoch 1 </h2>

Epoch one is our genesis airdrop that will start soon and be active for 50+ days, giving a short period for each tier of activations and farming to happen within the Zeebu protocol, helping to share the allocated 60 million $ZBU Tokens that will be airdropped within 2 weeks after the end of the campaign across each tier of rewards: Blue Tier, Silver Tier, Gold Tier, and Platinum Tier accordingly.
