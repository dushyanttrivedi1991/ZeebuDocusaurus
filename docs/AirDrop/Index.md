<h2> AirDrop </h2>

Our airdrop will consist of four epochs over a period of time that will be announced soon, starting with Epoch 1. This epoch will feature four reward tiers for the campaign: Blue Tier, Silver Tier, Gold Tier, and Platinum Tier.

These tiers serve as the initiation and growth campaign for Zeebu as it advances toward becoming a more decentralized entity, helping to uphold the ethos and principles that have guided Web3 so far.

Since its inception in 2023, Zeebu has championed transformative changes within the telecom industry, modernizing outdated payment systems and enhancing blockchain trust in the $120 billion telecom prepayment market. With the launch of the ZBU Protocol, Zeebu is driving a comprehensive architectural overhaul to establish a decentralized, distributed, and liquidity-optimized payment infrastructure. This innovative protocol reduces the telecom industry's standard transaction fees from 4-5% to 2% and decreases settlement times, creating an efficient pathway for telecom giants to serve retail markets.

The ZBU Airdrop is a foundational strategy to ensure fair distribution of tokens across the Zeebu ecosystem. With a total of 60 million ZBU allocated, the airdrop rewards and incentivizes active participants who contribute to the decentralized economy's success. These participants bolster the protocolâ€™s liquidity, contributing to its vision of becoming the largest decentralized liquidity protocol for B2B settlements.
