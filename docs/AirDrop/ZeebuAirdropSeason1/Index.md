2. **ZIPs, VeZBU, and VeLP Requirements**: Each tier requires a combination of ZIP points, VeZBU tokens, or VeLP tokens. Users must accumulate the necessary points/tokens to qualify for each tier.

3. **Invites Achievements**: Users can also advance tiers by successfully onboarding other users who meet tier requirements. For example:

    - Silver Tier requires 10 qualified invited users at Silver or higher.
    - Gold Tier requires 50 Silver invited users, 10 Gold, or 3 Platinum invited users.
    - Platinum Tier requires 100 Silver invited users, 40 Gold, or 10 Platinum invited users.

4. **NFT Minting for Tier Selection**: In the claim section, users will have the option to mint an NFT for the tier they qualify for. This NFT serves as proof of their tier status and eligibility.
