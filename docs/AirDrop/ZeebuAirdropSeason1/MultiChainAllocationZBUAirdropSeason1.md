<h2> Multi-Chain Allocation for ZBU Airdrop </h2>

To provide flexibility, decentralization, and broad access, the ZBU Protocol Airdrop for Season 1 will be distributed across multiple blockchain networks. A total of 60 million ZBU will be allocated for airdrop rewards, split evenly across three chains—Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and BASE. This approach ensures that users can choose their preferred chain for claiming rewards while ensuring the liquidity and scalability of the ZBU ecosystem across multiple platforms.

### Breakdown of Allocation

- Ethereum Chain (ERC): 20 million ZBU
- Binance Smart Chain (BSC): 20 million ZBU
- BASE Chain: 20 million ZBU

Each chain will have its own dedicated pool of ZBU tokens, with a total of 20 million ZBU allocated to each. Once the allocated tokens on a particular chain are fully claimed or "deprecated," users will no longer be able to claim tokens from that pool.

### Criteria and Considerations for Users

1. Select Chain at the Time of Claiming:
   - Users must choose their desired chain when claiming airdrop tokens. This is a one-time decision that cannot be altered later.

2. Act Quickly for Preferred Chain:
    - If users have a strong preference for a particular chain (due to gas fees, speed, or familiarity), it’s advisable to act swiftly before the token pool on that chain is depleted.
