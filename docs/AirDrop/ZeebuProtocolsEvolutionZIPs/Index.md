<h2> Zeebu Protocols Evolution Zips </h2>

### Overview of ZIP Points

ZIP (Zeebu Impact Points) serve as the cornerstone of user engagement within the ZBU Protocol, enabling users to progress through various tiers while supporting the ecosystem. ZIPs are farmed through a mix of SocialFi & Financial tasks, with point accrual directly impacting a user’s influence, rewards, and eligibility for tier upgrades.

## Weekly SocialFi Tasks

The **20-week progression** of Season 1, is structured to encourage consistent participation and engagement. Each week, users receive new SocialFi tasks and Financial challenges that allow them to farm ZIPs, with points accumulated contributing toward their tier progression and airdrop rewards.

    ### SocialFi Tasks
        - Weekly tasks are designed to build a strong social presence and foster community interaction.
        - **Examples**: Retweeting protocol updates, creating educational content, sharing insights on protocol features, and engaging with the community across platforms.
        - ZIPs are awarded based on task completion, with higher ZIPs for tasks that demonstrate meaningful engagement and contribution to the protocol’s social reach.
    
    ### Flash Quests
        - To keep participation dynamic, **Flash Quests** are introduced periodically, offering users the chance to farm additional ZIPs through time-limited tasks.
        - **Examples**: Completing bonus tasks during protocol updates, joining special events, or participating in AMAs.
        - These quests serve as quick engagement boosts, creating excitement within the community and rewarding users who are active and responsive.
    
    ### Financial Tasks
        - Financial tasks focus on actions that add direct value to the protocol, such as staking, holding, or providing liquidity.
        - ZIPs farmed from these tasks reflect the user’s financial commitment to the protocol and contribute to eligibility for higher tiers and rewards.
        - **Examples**: Staking ZBU tokens, holding a minimum balance over a set period, or contributing to liquidity pools.

        ***All the ZIPs will be able to claim in T+1 time, so task performed today you will be able to claim those ZIPs on next day. Clock resets at UTC 00***

## How ZIPs Drive ZBU Protocol’s Evolution

Through the accumulation of ZIPs, the protocol creates a multi-faceted engagement model that aligns with its goals of decentralization, transparency, and liquidity:

    - **Progressive User Engagement**: Weekly tasks ensure steady user involvement, creating a loyal and engaged user base over the 22-week period. As users accumulate ZIPs, they move up in tiers, access greater rewards, and strengthen their commitment to the protocol.

    - **Community-Driven Growth**: By offering tasks that blend SocialFi engagement with financial commitment, the protocol benefits from both expanded social reach and increased liquidity, directly impacting the protocol’s stability and reach.

    - **Continuous Incentives**: With ongoing tasks and periodic Flash Quests, users remain motivated, maintaining a continuous cycle of participation and reward. This structure ensures that ZBU Protocol’s community remains active, engaged, and aligned with the protocol’s growth objectives.

Through this structured progression, ZIPs effectively turn user contributions into growth, positioning the ZBU Protocol as a dynamic, user-centric platform with a strong foundation in decentralized finance.
