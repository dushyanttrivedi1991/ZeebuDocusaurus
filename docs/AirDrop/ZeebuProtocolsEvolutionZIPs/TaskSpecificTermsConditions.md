<h2> Task-Specific Terms and Conditions </h2>

### General Terms

- All these activities remain valid for using the official ZBU token of BSC, ETH, or BASE. Participants can choose the blockchain they are most comfortable with, allowing for broader accessibility and flexibility.

- If your wallet address is hacked, lost, or compromised in any scenario, you won't be able to reclaim your old account ZIP points, so your private key is crucial to your success. Ensure that you keep your account secure at all times and follow best practices for wallet security. ZBU Protocol is not responsible for any losses resulting from compromised wallets.

- You can claim all the ZIP points for your financial activities only once a day. The cut-off time is UTC 00 for all data reconciliation and calculation. You will receive your ZIP in T+1 time duration.

    - **Example**: You performed all the financial tasks on 30th October 2024, and the total value of ZIP is 50,000. You will be able to claim those ZIP once the system checks the legitimacy of it on 31st October at UTC 02:00. Participants should be aware of the cut-off time and ensure that all activities are completed before this deadline to qualify for daily claims.

### Hold ZBU Tokens

- A minimum holding of 10 ZBU tokens is required to be eligible to farm ZIP points. Holding ZBU tokens demonstrates a commitment to the protocol and ensures participants have a vested interest in the ecosystem's success.

- Users need to hold the balance in the wallet address used to register on zeebu.fi. Any movement of tokens to other wallets may result in disqualification from farming ZIP points.

- ZBU balance will be checked daily. This daily check ensures that participants are continuously maintaining their token holdings to qualify for points.

- Users will farm 625 base ZIP points for each ZBU held, and they will receive 1/4th of the base ZIP daily for each ZBU held.

    - **Example**: At the time of registration, if a user has 10 ZBU in their wallet, they will receive a base of 6,250 ZIP points. For each day that they continue to hold 10 ZBU, they will farm an additional 1/4th of the base ZIP, which is 156.25 ZIP per ZBU (1/4th of 625). Therefore, daily, the user will farm 1,562.5 ZIP for holding 10 ZBU. If after 2 days they have a total of 15 ZBU, they will receive 9,375 ZIP as a base (15 ZBU * 625). Daily, they will then farm 2,343.75 ZIP (15 ZBU * 156.25).

- Removing ZBU from the wallet will make participants ineligible for the airdrop claim. If a user has claimed ZIP for the ZBU balance holding and moves that ZBU out of their wallet, even for a minute, they will be ineligible at the time of airdrop claim.

    - **Example**: At the time of registration, if a user has 10 ZBU in their wallet, they will receive a base of 6,250 ZIP points and then farm 1,562.5 ZIP daily. If the user removes 5 ZBU from their wallet, they will no longer be eligible for the airdrop claim even if they return the tokens shortly thereafter.

- If ZBU is staked for VeZBU, participants will remain eligible for the airdrop claim.

    - **Example**: At the time of registration, if a user has 10 ZBU in their wallet, they will receive 6,250 ZIP points and farm 1,562.5 ZIP daily. If the user stakes 5 ZBU at zeebu.fi/stake and has 5 ZBU left in their wallet, this is a valid action, and the user will not face any ineligibility for it.

### Stake VeZBU

- Participants must stake ZBU to receive VeZBU on zeebu.fi/stake. The staking process is straightforward, and participants are encouraged to stake as much ZBU as possible to maximize their rewards.

- ZIP points are awarded daily at a rate of VeZBU * 2500 and must be claimed before the end of each day. Daily claiming ensures that participants are active and engaged with the platform.

- How much VeZBU you get for each ZBU staked based on time of lock:
    - 1 ZBU staked for 1 day = 0.0006845 VeZBU (This VeZBU will remain the same if you stake for less than 6 months).
    - 1 ZBU staked for 6 months = 0.125 VeZBU (This VeZBU will remain the same if you stake for more than 6 months but less than 1 year).
    - 1 ZBU staked for 1 year = 0.50 VeZBU (This VeZBU will remain the same if you stake for more than 1 year but less than 2 years).
    - 1 ZBU staked for 2 years = 1 VeZBU.
    - **Example**: If you stake 1 ZBU for 2 years, you will receive 1 VeZBU, which means you will get 625 ZIP daily. On Day 1, you will have 2500 ZIP, and on Day 2, you will have 5000 ZIP (2500 from Day 1 + 2500 from Day 2).

- Unclaimed ZIP points will not be available for later claims in any scenario, so ensure that you do a daily check-in and claim points.

### Hold LP Tokens

- A minimum holding of 100 LP tokens is required to be eligible to farm ZIP points. Holding ZBU tokens demonstrates a commitment to the protocol and ensures participants have a vested interest in the ecosystem's success.

- Users need to hold the balance in the wallet address used to register on zeebu.fi. Any movement of tokens to other wallets may result in disqualification from farming ZIP points.

- LP balance will be checked daily. This daily check ensures that participants are continuously maintaining their token holdings to qualify for points.

- Users will farm 625 base ZIP points for each ZBU held, and they will receive 1/4th of the base ZIP daily for each ZBU held.

    - **Example**: At the time of registration, if a user has 10 LP in their wallet, they will receive a base of 6,250 ZIP points. For each day that they continue to hold 10 LP, they will farm an additional 1/4th of the base ZIP, which is 156.25 ZIP per LP (1/4th of 625). Therefore, daily, the user will farm 1,562.5 ZIP for holding 10 LP. If after 2 days they have a total of 15 LP, they will receive 9,375 ZIP as a base (15 LP * 625). Daily, they will then farm 2,343.75 ZIP (15 LP * 156.25).

- Removing LP from the wallet will make participants ineligible for the airdrop claim. If a user has claimed ZIP for the LP balance holding and moves that LP out of their wallet, even for a minute, they will be ineligible at the time of airdrop claim.

    - **Example**: At the time of registration, if a user has 10 LP in their wallet, they will receive a base of 6,250 ZIP points and then farm 1,562.5 ZIP daily. If the user removes 5 LP from their wallet, they will no longer be eligible for the airdrop claim even if they return the tokens shortly thereafter.

- If LP is staked for VeZBU, participants will remain eligible for the airdrop claim.

    - **Example**: At the time of registration, if a user has 10 LP in their wallet, they will receive 6,250 ZIP points and farm 1,562.5 ZIP daily. If the user stakes 5 LP at zeebu.fi/stake and has 5 LP left in their wallet, this is a valid action, and the user will not face any ineligibility for it.

### Stake VeLP

- Participants must stake LP tokens to receive VeLP on zeebu.fi/stake. Staking LP tokens helps support the liquidity of the ecosystem and rewards participants for their contribution.

- ZIP points are awarded daily at a rate of VeLP * 2500 and must be claimed before the end of each day. Participants must be diligent in claiming their rewards daily to ensure they do not miss out on any farmed ZIP points.

- How much VeLP you get for each LP staked based on time of lock:
    - 1 LP staked for 1 day = 0.0006845 VeLP (This VeLP will remain the same if you stake for less than 6 months).
    - 1 LP staked for 6 months = 0.125 VeLP (This VeLP will remain the same if you stake for more than 6 months but less than 1 year).
    - 1 LP staked for 1 year = 0.50 VeLP (This VeLP will remain the same if you stake for more than 1 year but less than 2 years).
    - 1 LP staked for 2 years = 1 VeLP.
    - **Example**: If you stake 1 LP for 2 years, you will receive 1 VeLP, which means you will get 2500 ZIP daily. On Day 1, you will have 2500 ZIP, and on Day 2, you will have 5000 ZIP (2500 from Day 1 + 2500 from Day 2).

- Unclaimed ZIP points will not be available for later claims in any scenario, so ensure that you do a daily check-in and claim points.

### Swap ZBU/USDC

- Participants must complete a ZBU/USDC swap of at least $50 in value in their wallet address used to register on zeebu.fi to farm ZIP points. Swapping helps maintain the liquidity of the protocol and ensures market activity.

- The first buy or sell transactions each qualify for 625 ZIP points.
    - **Example**: Swap 55 USDC to ZBU = 625 ZIP or Swap 10 ZBU to USDC = 625 ZIP.

- These ZIP points are a fixed allocation and are not dependent on the swap amount; only a minimum value of $50 is required. ZIP points won't change if the swap value is $500, $5,000, $50,000, etc. Participants should aim to meet the minimum requirement to qualify for the points, but larger transactions will not result in additional points.
