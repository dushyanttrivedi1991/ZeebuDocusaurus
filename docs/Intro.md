<h2> Introduction </h2>

The telecom wholesale industry is a vital part of the global telecommunications ecosystem, facilitating the exchange of voice, data, and messaging services between carriers and operators. However, this sector is fraught with several challenges, including inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and high costs, which all lead to revenue loss for telecom wholesale voice businesses.

With the advent of Web3 technology, there is an opportunity to address these pain points to create a more efficient, secure and cost-effective telecom wholesale ecosystem. Zeebu aims to leverage blockchain, tokens and smart contract technology to create a decentralized marketplace for telecom operators, carriers, and service providers, enabling them to transact with each other securely and seamlessly, and earn rewards for every transaction made on the platform.

The platformâ€™s key features will include transparent pricing, smart contract-enabled payment settlements, reducing the need for intermediaries and manual intervention. Additionally, the platform will provide loyalty token rewards for every transaction made on the platform, incentivizing both buyers and sellers to participate in the ecosystem.

Zeebu has the potential to revolutionize the telecom wholesale industry by reducing costs, improving efficiencies, and increasing transparency. By leveraging decentralized technology, the platform will empower businesses to transact with confidence, leading to increased revenue and profitability.
