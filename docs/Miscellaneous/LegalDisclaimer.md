<h2> Legal Disclaimer </h2>

- This document has been prepared for informational purposes only, and is not investment advice or a solicitation of Zeebu Token (“ZBU”). None of the contents of this document compel you to participate in buying ZBU. Nothing in this document can be regarded as an invitation to participate in a transaction, including the right to obtain a copy of this document or sharing it with others.

- You understand and agree that if and when ZBU is made available to you, the time it actually takes for you to receive ZBU into your digital wallet may vary, and ZBU received and displayed on your wallet shall be final. Zeebu Loyalty Rewards Limited , and any of their affiliates (collectively “Zeebu”) are not liable for any losses resulting from the aforementioned.

- Zeebu is not responsible for any losses resulting from sending or transferring ZBU to the wrong address(es) or wallets. You shall provide a correct address of your digital wallet that you use to receive ZBU. Zeebu is not liable for any and all losses resulting from your own fault or error, including but not limited to you providing an incorrect address of your digital wallet or other address for receiving ZBU, or you transferring ZBU to a wrong address or wallet.

- You understand and accept that Zeebu is not liable for any losses caused by any risks relating to your eligibility to access or use ZBU.

- You understand that Zeebu is not providing any financial or investment advice in connection with ZBU. You understand that Zeebu is not a broker-dealer and is not purchasing or selling any securities. ZBU are not shares or securities of any type. ZBU do not entitle you to any ownership or other interest in Zeebu.

- The regulatory regimes governing blockchain technologies, blockchain assets, and the purchase and sale of blockchain assets are uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially and adversely affect the development of Zeebu and the use of blockchain assets.

- Blockchain is a nascent and rapidly-changing technology and use of blockchain networks and blockchain assets in the retail and commercial marketplace remains relatively small. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of blockchain networks may adversely affect the value of any blockchain assets purchased through Zeebu.

- You acknowledge that the platform, systems, and technology described in this document are under development. They may undergo significant changes. Although Zeebu intends to implement the features and specifications set forth in this document, Zeebu has no obligation to implement any portion of this document, and may discontinue the project in its sole discretion, for any reason or no reason at all, including due to lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success, or the departure of key personnel.

- Blockchains may be susceptible to malicious cyber-attacks or may contain exploitable flaws, which may result in security breaches and the loss or theft of blockchain assets. Blockchains often incorporate third-party software components, including open-source software. Third-party software components, including open-source software, may not be represented, maintained, or monitored by an official organization or authority, or any such maintenance or monitoring may not be adequate to protect against exploitable flaws. Third parties may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructure elements of the blockchain network. This could result in the corruption of the software code which may result in the loss or theft of blockchain assets. Blockchains may be the target of malicious attacks seeking to identify and exploit weaknesses in the software. Such events may result in a loss of trust in the security and operation of blockchains and a decline in user activity which could have a negative impact on any blockchain assets you own. These cyber-attacks or other technical errors could harm the value of ZBU.

- There is substantial regulatory uncertainty surrounding the treatment of blockchain tokens by the SEC, CFTC, FinCEN, and other regulators. In addition, changes of presidential administration in the United States, including changes in the leadership of each of these organizations and other regulatory agencies, create additional regulatory uncertainty. Public statements by the SEC and recent enforcement actions brought by the SEC and by state regulators demonstrate that the SEC and state regulators intend to take an active approach in the application of the U.S. securities laws to digital assets, including tokens and stablecoins as well as decentralized finance platforms and other projects in the digital asset space. There can be no assurance as to how these regulatory agencies and others will treat blockchain assets in the future, but continued increased enforcement and regulation is expected. In addition, legislation that is currently pending in the United States Congress, if enacted into law, may affect the treatment of the issuance, sale, reporting, and taxation of digital assets.

- Zeebu has no obligation to update this document. Purchasers of ZBU understand that Zeebu may alter this business model, the tokenomics of ZBU, and the Zeebu Blockchain. Purchasers of ZBU do not have the right to access the books and records of Zeebu and are not entitled to periodic updates or any updates at all.

- Purchasers of ZBU understand that ZBU is subject to market conditions and could fluctuate in value. The viability of ZBU is dependent on market acceptance. Purchasers of ZBU also understand that it could be difficult or impossible to convert ZBU to other cryptocurrencies or fiat, which is dependent on whether decentralized exchanges and centralized exchanges adopt ZBU. Purchasers of ZBU should understand that they may lose the entirety of the cryptocurrency and fiat used to purchase ZBU. You also acknowledge that the market price of ZBU may fluctuate dramatically and may be reduced to zero.
