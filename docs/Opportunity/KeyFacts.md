<div class="subtitle">Telecom Carrier Businesses: Providing Essential Behind-the-Scenes Network Connectivity</div>

The **Telecom Carrier** industry is a crucial component of the larger telecommunications industry. Telecom carriers provide wholesale telecommunications services using their network connectivity. These services include voice, data, wireless and internet access options. The telecom carrier industry is comprised of three types of carrier services:

**Voice Carriers** own and operate large, high-capacity networks that carry large volumes of voice traffic between different locations and networks. Their services include long-distance calling, toll-free services, and international calling.

**SMS Carriers** provide SMS (Short Message Service) messaging services to other businesses, carriers, and service providers on a wholesale basis. Their services include application-to-person messaging (A2P), person-to-person messaging (P2P), and bulk messaging services.

**Data Carriers operate high-capacity networks that allow them to carry large volumes of data traffic between different networks.** Their services include dedicated internet access, multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), and Ethernet services. These services can be customized to meet the specific needs of different customers, such as high bandwidth requirements or low latency.

The telecom carrier industry is a major player in the telecommunications industry, contributing to approximately 4% of its overall business. The $120 billion global business comprises over 6,000 players worldwide, providing various voice, data, wireless and internet access options [3].

Telecom carrier networks offer global connectivity to mobile operators. Their high-capacity networks transport voice, data and messaging traffic, enabling mobile operators to provide their customers with seamless connectivity across different networks and locations.
