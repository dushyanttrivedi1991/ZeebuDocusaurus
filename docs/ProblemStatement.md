<h2> Problem Statement </h2>

The telecom wholesale voice industry is critical for global telecommunications, acting as a backbone that facilitates the exchange of voice, data and messaging services between carriers and operators. However, the industry is plagued by several challenges, including inefficient processes, long remittance delays, lack of transparency, revenue loss due to currency exchange, and high costs. All of these challenges lead to revenue loss for industry players.

The current telecom wholesale voice industry relies on intermediaries and manual intervention, resulting in slow and cumbersome processes. The lack of transparency in pricing and settlements further compounds these issues, leading to disputes and delayed payments. Additionally, the absence of real-time data analytics hinders carriers and operators from making data-driven decisions, affecting their operational efficiency.

Furthermore, the industry is exposed to several security threats, including fraudulent activities and cyber-attacks, leading to significant losses for businesses. These issues make it imperative to find a solution that can address the challenges faced by the industry, create efficiencies and provide a secure platform for transactions.

Web3 technology provides a unique opportunity to solve the pain points of the telecom wholesale industry. By leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology, a decentralized marketplace can be created that facilitates secure and seamless transactions between carriers, operators, and service providers. The decentralized nature of the platform ensures transparency in pricing and settlement, reduces the need for intermediaries, and enables automated dispute resolution.

Thus, the industry is primed for a Web3 application that can revolutionize operations, reducing costs, making settlements faster, and making the process transparent for all players. Zeebu has the potential to provide a secure, transparent and efficient marketplace for telecom operators, carriers, and service providers, enabling them to transact with confidence and drive growth for their businesses.
