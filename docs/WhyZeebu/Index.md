<h2> Why Zeebu </h2>
<div class="subtitle">The Transformative Power of Zeebu Loyalty Utility Tokens</div>

The Zeebu loyalty utility token is the world’s first token for business-to-business (B2B) loyalty rewards, specifically tailored for the telecom carrier industry. The Zeebu loyalty utility token is built on the Ethereum network to incentivize and reward telecom carriers and their partners for participating in the Zeebu ecosystem[1] . The Zeebu token seamlessly integrates into the Zeebu platform, providing a cohesive experience to partners, offering multiple services without the need for additional infrastructure or resources.

The Zeebu token is a powerful and redeemable loyalty token that provides several key benefits to telecom carriers. Firstly, it eliminates the need for conventional banking channels and intermediaries to complete cross-border settlements, resulting in substantial cost savings for the high volume telecom carrier business. Zeebu ecosystem partners have the potential to achieve a bottom-line growth of up to 120%.

Zeebu token transactions are fast and frictionless. High-velocity cross-border transactions are prone to delays due to the complex and disparate processes to complete the transactions across geographies and regulatory constraints. Zeebu tokens eliminate the manual settlement process and speed up transactions by removing multiple regulatory, technical, currency crunch and time zone complexities.

The Zeebu token also provides loyalty rewards to participants in the Zeebu B2B ecosystem. As the first use case, Zeebu tokens will empower Zeebu’s unified settlement platform and reward the partners who come on board. Customers and merchants earn loyalty rewards for each successfully settled transaction on the platform, which can be used to settle invoices or be instantly liquidated on token exchanges.

Zeebu tokens are native on ECR20 and Pegged to BEP20 & BASE ERC20, and transactions made using Zeebu tokens are transparent, immutable, viewable on the Ethereum public ledger, validated on the decentralized network, and traceable. The intrinsic features of blockchain make Zeebu transactions transparent, ensuring trust among partners using the trustless blockchain mechanism.

Security is one of the most significant concerns for cross-border transactions and we designed the Zeebu platform with these concerns in mind. The Zeebu token is protected by complex encryption algorithms and distributed across a network of nodes to reduce the risk of fraud and cyber attacks. The Zeebu platform offers enterprise grade security to protect the private information of its ecosystem partners.

Zeebu tokens are integrated with smart contract technology, automating the settlement process and ensuring revenue is settled quickly and accurately. Smart contracts are programmed to execute automatically when predetermined conditions are met, such as at a predefined interval or when reaching a set billing threshold. Smart contract-driven settlements using Zeebu tokens improve business efficiency and reduce transaction costs.
