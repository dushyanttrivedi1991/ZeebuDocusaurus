<h2> Zeebu </h2>

The protocol architecture centers on an automated settlement system powered by smart contracts. This system operates through a network of Deployers who act as validators, processing transactions and maintaining network security. Supporting this structure is the Phoenix Protocol for token conversions and burns, while a Treasury manages token swaps and system stability. Liquidity pools ensure continuous transaction flow.

Network participants fall into distinct categories with specific roles and benefits. Deployers stake a minimum of 200,000 ZBU, process transactions, and earn 0.6% of settlement volume through lock periods ranging from 6 months to 2 years. On-chain Liquidity Providers supply settlement liquidity, maintain token pool ratios, and earn 0.8% of transaction volume while enabling instant settlements. Merchants and customers submit and pay invoices with reduced fees of 2% total, compared to traditional 4-5% fees.

Zeebu irepresents a groundbreaking fusion of telecom settlements and decentralized finance, powered by its native ZBU token. At its core, the protocol addresses the long-standing challenges in telecom wholesale settlements: delayed payments, high transaction costs, and inefficient liquidity management. Through its innovative multi-token ecosystem, Zeebu transforms traditional settlement processes into seamless, automated transactions.

The protocol's architecture is elegantly simple yet powerful. ZBU, the primary utility token, works in concert with veZBU (vote-escrowed ZBU), IUSDOX (internal stablecoin), and USDT to create a comprehensive settlement solution. This multi-token approach ensures both stability and efficiency while providing attractive yield opportunities for participants.

At the heart of Zeebu's ecosystem are three key participants: Deployers, who operate nodes and manage smart contracts with a minimum stake of 200,000 ZBU; On-Chain Liquidity Providers (OLPs), who ensure ample settlement liquidity; and Delegators, who contribute to network security through staking. Each role is carefully incentivized, with rewards ranging from 0.6% to 0.8% of transaction volume, creating a sustainable economic model.

The protocol's growth trajectory is impressive, with projected transaction volumes reaching $13.89 billion in 2024 and $21.81 billion in 2025. These volumes translate to substantial yields, with protocol APY projected at 27.8% in 2024. Through its Phoenix Protocol for token conversions and a robust treasury system for token management, Zeebu ensures long-term sustainability while delivering immediate value to participants.

By combining blockchain technology with deep telecom industry expertise, Zeebu Protocol is not just solving today's settlement challenges – it's building the foundation for tomorrow's telecom financial ecosystem. The ZBU token sits at the center of this transformation, serving as both a utility token for settlements and a governance token for protocol evolution, making Zeebu a pivotal player in the future of telecom finance.

By leveraging blockchain technology, Zeebu offers a secure, trustless platform where buyers and sellers can directly invoice each other. This system provides transparent and auditable transaction records, reducing the risk of fraud and disputes. Additionally, the integration of smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols enables fast, seamless payments without relying on traditional banking intermediaries.

Zeebu’s key advantage lies in dramatically reducing transaction fees from the typical 4-5% to a total of 2%—1% for merchants and 1% for clients—resulting in significant cost savings for companies, in the tens of millions annually. Furthermore, settlement times, which traditionally take 90 to 120 days, are reduced to just minutes, allowing telecom companies to free up capital for more productive use, rather than having it tied up in prolonged settlement processes.
