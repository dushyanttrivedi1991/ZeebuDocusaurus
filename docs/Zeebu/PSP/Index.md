<h2> PSP </h2>

Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and telecom companies form the backbone of the Zeebu Protocol, serving as the primary users and beneficiaries of the system. The two key roles within this connection are merchants and clients in the telecoms pre-payment world. For more information on Telecom prepayments, click here.

Zeebu’s key advantage lies in dramatically reducing transaction fees from the typical 4-5% to a total of 2%—1% for merchants and 1% for clients—resulting in significant cost savings for companies, in the tens of millions annually. Furthermore, settlement times, which traditionally take 90 to 120 days, are reduced to just minutes, allowing telecom companies to free up capital for more productive use, rather than having it tied up in prolonged settlement processes.

There are two key segments within this category: merchants and customers.
