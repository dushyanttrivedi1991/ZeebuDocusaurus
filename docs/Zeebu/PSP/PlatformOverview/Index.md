<h2> Platform Overview </h2>

Telecom companies are the primary users of the Zeebu PSP (Payment Service Provider). This role can be divided into two segments: merchants and customers (clients). Both segments benefit from Zeebuâ€™s reduced settlement times and lower costs.

When merchants and clients anticipate international travel from anyone on their respective networks, each network must pre-pay for the expected usage of minutes, SMS, and data in foreign countries. This prepayment industry is valued at $120 billion, with 4-5% transaction fees on traditional payment rails on each international prepayment for expected SMS, data, and minute usage.

This is where the magic comes in. Zeebu has disrupted these traditional payment rails by offering much lower settlement times and lower fees. Each party (merchant and client) pays Zeebu a 1% fee, totaling a 2% fee on the processed volume through the network, saving millions in fees each year.
