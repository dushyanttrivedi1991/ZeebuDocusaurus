<h2> Technology </h2>

Zeebuâ€™s comprehensive platform is built to service the telecom carrier industry across the globe. The platform offers a suite of services that simplify invoicing and transaction settlement for the telecom carrier industry, making processes both efficient and user-friendly. The platform caters specifically to the needs of two key players in the telecom carrier industry: merchants and customers.

In order to successfully cater to the needs of both customers and merchants, the Zeebu platform is built with proprietary components and has partnered with the Zeebu Payment Processor to enable simple crypto-to-fiat and fiat-to-crypto transactions.

Each telecom carrier business in the ecosystem typically operates in a dual capacity as both a merchant and a customer. These carrier businesses transact regularly with other carriers in different geographic locations. The Zeebu platform offers a singular business view with a unified transaction system, making cross-border operations smoother and more transparent.
