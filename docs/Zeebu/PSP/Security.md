<h2> Security </h2>

At Zeebu, we prioritize security and regulatory compliance to ensure the highest levels of safety and trust for our users. Our platform has implemented a range of measures to protect assets and data alike, and meet the highest security standards

### Security Details

Zeebu uses a third-party auditing agency, Certik, to independently audit our platform and ensure it meets the highest security standards. Our platform is also compliant with the widely recognized Service Organization Control 2 (SoC2) standard for data security and availability. SoC2 is a type of audit report that analyzes the controls implemented by a service organization to ensure the security, availability and processing integrity of its hosted data. SoC2 compliance demonstrates that a service organization has implemented robust controls to safeguard customer data and ensure its availability.

Zeebu also utilizes 256-bit encryption and a multi-sig decentralized exchange (DEX) wallet to protect assets, ensuring funds are always secure and can only be accessed with the userâ€™s explicit approval. 256-bit encryption is a cryptographic algorithm that uses a key length of 256 bits to encrypt and decrypt data. 256-bit encryption is an industry standard and highly secure; it is estimated that it would take an enormous amount of computing power and billions of years to crack the encryption by brute force. Multi-sig DEX wallets require the approval of multiple parties before any funds can be moved or spent. This provides an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access to funds and reduces the risk of theft or fraud.

We also follow Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) compliance guidelines to prevent common web application vulnerabilities. OWASP is a non-profit organization that provides free resources, tools, and guidance to help developers create more secure web applications. By following OWASP guidelines, developers greatly reduce the risk of security threats, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and session highjacking. OWASP compliance is an important aspect of web application security; Zeebu has ensured the protection of its platform against a wide range of threats and vulnerabilities by complying with these standards.

Additionally, we have implemented Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection to ensure our platform remains available and responsive, even during high traffic or attacks. DDoS protection is a security measure that helps prevent websites and online services from being overwhelmed by a flood of traffic from multiple sources. DDoS protection works by using a combination of techniques to identify and filter out malicious traffic, while allowing legitimate traffic to pass through. By implementing DDoS protection, Zeebu ensures the availability and reliability of its service.

Security and compliance are critical aspects of our decentralized platform, and we implement a robust KYC process to verify the identity of our users and prevent unauthorized access and fraudulent activities. We have also implemented AML policies to prevent money laundering activities, terrorist financing, illegal drug trafficking, and other financial crimes. Furthermore, we leverage advanced technology, including smart contracts, to detect and prevent fraudulent activities like fake transactions and double-spending attacks. By prioritizing regulatory compliance and security measures, we ensure that our users can transact with confidence on the Zeebu platform.

Each audit firm brings specialized expertise, scrutinizing different aspects of Zeebu's architecture. This multi-faceted approach ensures a thorough evaluation of the protocol's security measures, from smart contract integrity to potential vulnerabilities in the overall system design.

### Risk Mitigation

Zeebu takes a proactive stance on risk mitigation, addressing a spectrum of threats from technical vulnerabilities to economic attacks. The protocol's security strategy is multi-faceted, integrating safeguards at every level to create a robust ecosystem.

This includes defenses against smart contract vulnerabilities, validator collusion, liquidity drains, governance attacks, token inflation or deflation, and network downtime. Each of these potential risks is addressed through a combination of technical safeguards, economic incentives, and governance structures designed to maintain the integrity and stability of the Zeebu ecosystem.

### Legal Disclaimer

The Zeebu protocol operates in a complex regulatory landscape. Users are strongly advised to carefully consider these factors and consult with legal and financial professionals when deemed appropriate before engaging with the Zeebu ecosystem.

### Key Addresses

Zeebu maintains transparency by providing key addresses related to its operations. These addresses are crucial for users and stakeholders to verify transactions, token distributions, and other on-chain activities. However, specific address information is not included in this overview to maintain security. Users should always verify key addresses through official Zeebu channels to avoid potential scams or phishing attempts.
