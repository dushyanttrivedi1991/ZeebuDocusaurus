<h2> Tokonomics </h2>

The ZBU loyalty utility token is designed to introduce a B2B loyalty program and revolutionize global business transaction settlements. The ZBU token is built on Ethereum's ERC20, Binance Smart Chain BEP20 Standards & BASE's ERC20. ZBU tokens will be interoperable between these two blockchain platforms. The primary use-case of this token is to ensure a cost-effective, fast, and transparent mechanism of transaction settlement and offer loyalty rewards to Zeebu ecosystem partners.

### Token Information

The Zeebu token will have the symbol “ZBU”. The token can be recognized as ZBU on various platforms. The ZBU token has a fixed **5 billion token supply** and follows the deflationary model. The ZBU token can be divided **up to 18 digits after the decimal.**

### Token Distribution

At the launch stage, ZBU will be listed to the major decentralized exchanges, such as Uniswap, so ecosystem partners can acquire tokens for transaction settlement. In the next stage, ZBU tokens will be made available on centralized exchanges to expand the token availability for the ecosystem partners in different geographies. In addition, early backers to the platform can buy the ZBU tokens over the counter prior to the token launch.

### Token Utility

- **Transaction settlement** -  Authorized merchants and customers will settle their invoices using ZBU tokens.

- **Loyalty rewards** - Authorized merchants and customers will receive ZBU token rewards on each successfully settled invoice. Merchants and customers each receive rewards of upto 2.5% of the invoice value in ZBU.

- **Governance rewards** - ZBU tokens will be used to provide additional governance rewards to early backers who contribute to the platform governance.

- **Transaction fee** - ZBU tokens will be used to pay the transaction fee to the payment processor for settling transactions.
