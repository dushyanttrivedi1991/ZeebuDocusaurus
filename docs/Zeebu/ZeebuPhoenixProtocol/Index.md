<h2> Zeebu Phoenix Protocol </h2>

The Zeebu Protocol is a groundbreaking blockchain-based system designed to streamline and optimize telecom settlements. It leverages cutting-edge technology to address long standing industry inefficiencies, creating a more transparent, efficient, and trustworthy ecosystem for all participants.

At its core, the Zeebu Protocol facilitates near-instantaneous, low-cost settlements between telecom carriers, eliminating the need for traditional, time-consuming processes. By utilizing smart contracts and a native token (ZBU), the protocol automates many aspects of the settlement process, reducing fees, errors and decreasing settlement times.
