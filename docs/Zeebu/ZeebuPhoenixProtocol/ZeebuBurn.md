<h2> Zeebu Burn </h2>

### Objective

To ensure the ongoing viability of ZBU to continue to be a means of settling telecom invoices it is important that ZBU prices do not experience significant fluctuations. Accordingly, Zeebu has developed a redemption mechanism in which the ZBU that will be redeemed for fiat will be burned.

### Burning Rate

The amount of ZBU burned will be equal to the redemptions for fiat sought on the Platform. Zeebu will continue to evaluate the need for price stability and may alter the burn rate, but not without prior written notice.

### Formula for Quarterly Token Burn

To maintain absolute transparency, here’s our formula:

</div>

This formula encapsulates:

- **Total Quarterly Consumption**: This is the aggregate settlement volume on our platform over a three-month period. It’s calculated as Daily Settlement Volume multiplied by the number of days in the quarter.

- **Closing Day Token Price**: This is the average market price of ZBU on the day of burning, ensuring fairness in our approach.

### Burning Mechanics

Our commitment to market stability is reflected in the periodic burning of ZBU. When considering adjustments to the burn rate, we take into account a multitude of factors:


- Market adoption rates and transaction volume spikes.
- Shifts in local and global telecom markets.
- Regulatory changes impacting our operations.
- Fluctuations in foreign exchange and crypto markets.
- Advancements in blockchain technology.
- Political stability in regions where ZBU is heavily utilized.
- Variations in transaction fees within the telecom industry.

### Governance & Transparency

At the heart of ZBU Phoenix Protocol is a system designed with our community's best interests in mind. Governed by clear-cut rules, this framework ensures predictability and openness in our operations. Our oversight team, comprising seasoned professionals, oversees the meticulous execution of the burn process. Plus, the immutability of our smart contracts adds an extra layer of trust.

In the spirit of transparency, we'll publish detailed quarterly reports and disclose all fund storage addresses. To further stabilize price volatility, token purchases will be based on the quarter's ending day price. All tokens are set to be burned on Ethereum and BSC at the designated dead address.

### Differential Tokens and Sustainability

Fostering sustainability, differential tokens from our accumulated burning pool are allocated to ZBU CLUB for community growth and development. This not only supports our ecosystem but also ensures long-term viability and innovation.
