<h2> Zeebu Node </h2>

Zeebu's innovative node activation process is the cornerstone of its network expansion strategy. This two-stage approach – Pre-live and Live nodes – creates a pathway for gradual, sustainable growth while offering compelling incentives for early adopters and community engagement.

### Why Run a Zeebu Node?

1. Influence and Impact: As a node operator, you'll play a crucial role in shaping the future of telecom settlements. Your node will directly contribute to processing transactions and maintaining network integrity.

2. Portfolio Diversity: Running a Zeebu node offers a unique opportunity to diversify your crypto portfolio beyond traditional assets. It's a chance to be part of a groundbreaking project in the telecom-blockchain intersection.

3. Real-World Rewards: Unlike many protocols, Zeebu nodes generate rewards from actual telecom transactions. 

4. Community Building: Your node becomes a focal point for your community. As delegators stake to your node, you're not just earning rewards – you're building a dedicated following within the Zeebu ecosystem.

### Node Staking Breakdown

### Pre-Live Node State

When you first activate your node, it enters the Pre-Live state. This is a crucial phase for building momentum:

    - **Base APY**: Pre-Live nodes offer a base APY of 25% to delegators, derived from providing the active service of staking their ZBU tokens to the network, incentivizing early staking.

    - **Community Building**: Use this phase to educate your audience about Zeebu and encourage delegation.

    - **Preparation for Live Status**: Work towards accumulating 200,000 ZBU in delegations to transition to Live status.

For a detailed breakdown of the Pre-Live state and its benefits, visit our Pre-Live Node page.

### Transitioning to Live Node

Once your node accumulates 200,000 ZBU in delegations, it becomes eligible for Live status. Live nodes process actual transactions and earn rewards based on network activity. Learn more about the opportunities and responsibilities of Live nodes on our Live Node page.
