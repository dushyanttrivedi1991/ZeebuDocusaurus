<h2> Benefits </h2>

**Flexible Staking Options**: Choose from various node operators or become one yourself, allowing you to tailor your involvement according to the competetitve APY given by node operators.

**Real-World Utility**: By staking ZBU, you're supporting a platform that's disrupting the traditional payments rails of the telecom industry. 

**Deflationary Token Economics**: Zeebu's burning mechanism creates deflationary pressure, decreasing the total available ZBU tokens on the market every quarter.

**Real-World Backed Returns**: Your rewards are generated from actual telecom transaction settlements, not speculative trading.

**Market-Uncorrelated Opportunity**: Because rewards are tied to real-world economic activity, your returns are largely insulated from crypto market volatility.

**Conservative Position**: The liquidity pool requires only 25% exposure to ZBU tokens, with the remaining 75% in USDT, offering a more conservative position compared to many crypto opportunities.

**Flexible Participation**: Choose your level of involvement based on your available resources and goals.
