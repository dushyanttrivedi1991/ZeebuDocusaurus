<h2> General Node </h2>

### What Is A General Node?

A General Node operates as a decentralized access point in the Zeebu network, processing settlements and transactions. While private nodes demand an upfront stake of 200,000 ZBU, General nodes offer a more accessible path. Operators can start with a smaller amount and grow their stake through community delegation, making the network more inclusive and distributed.

### Who Can Participate?

General nodes welcome community leaders who shape the cryptocurrency landscape. This includes established voices in digital assets, managers of investment clubs, builders of online communities, and leaders of Web3 projects. These individuals bring their expertise and networks to strengthen the Zeebu ecosystem.

### Incentives

The General node system offers two distinct reward phases. During the Pre-Live phase, operators earn up to 4-6% from all staked amounts under 200,000 ZBU. Once reaching Live status, nodes earn up to up to 45% APY from network participation, with operators deciding how to share these rewards with their delegators.

The network also features two airdrop tiers to reward significant stake commitments. The Gold tier grants 50,000 ZBU for reaching 200,000 ZBU staked, while the Platinum tier awards 200,000 ZBU for accumulating 1,000,000 ZBU in stake.

### Responsibilities

General node operators serve as network stewards. They ensure consistent node operation, handle transaction processing, and build active delegator communities. Operators must work toward meeting minimum stake requirements while managing reward distribution to their delegators. This role demands active engagement with both technical operations and community management.

### How To Participate

1. Submit application through official form
2. Pass verification process
3. Set up node infrastructure
4. Attract delegators
5. Achieve minimum stake threshold

The network includes a built-in safety mechanism: if a node doesn't reach the 200,000 ZBU threshold during the Pre-Live phase, all staked funds automatically move to an active Live Node. This ensures delegators continue earning rewards regardless of their chosen node's status.
