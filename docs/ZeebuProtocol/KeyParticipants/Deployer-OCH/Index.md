<h2> Deployer OCH </h2>

On-chain clearing houses serve as the on-chain clearing house in the Zeebu ecosystem, essential for validating transactions and maintaining the network's integrity. This approach transforms traditional telecom settlements into a decentralized, efficient, and transparent process.

There are two types of On-chain clearing houses within the Zeebu ecosystem.

- **Private Deployers**: These deployers must be approved by Zeebu and have 200,000 ZBU to initiate their node, and be willing to lock up 200,000 ZBU for a duration of 2 years. Circumventing the Pre-Live status entirely.

- **Public Deployers**: Anyone can serve as a public Deployer, and must work towards accruing a total of 200,000 ZBU delegated to their node before achieving live node status. Public deployers must achieve Delegators staking ZBU to their Node.
