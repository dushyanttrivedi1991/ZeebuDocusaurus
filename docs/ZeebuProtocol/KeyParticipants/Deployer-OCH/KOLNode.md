<h2> KOL Node </h2>

### What Is A KOL Node?

A KOL Node forms part of Zeebu's premium network infrastructure, designed for key opinion leaders and influential community builders. Each node in this tier requires 200,000 ZBU, with operators leveraging their reach to build significant network participation. These nodes handle critical transaction processing while maintaining strong community engagement.

### Who Can Participate?

KOL Nodes target established voices in the digital asset space. This includes cryptocurrency thought leaders, investment club managers, venture capital firms, and hedge funds. Participants need proven track records of community building and market influence, along with the capacity to maintain substantial network stakes.

### Incentives

KOL Node operators access multiple revenue streams. The base reward structure delivers up to 45%+ APY for active network participation. Early participants qualify for tiered airdrops: Gold Tier awards 50,000 ZBU for 200,000 ZBU staked, while Platinum Tier provides 200,000 ZBU for 1,000,000 ZBU staked. Operators maintain priority status in node claiming processes

### Responsibilities

Operators must maintain robust network infrastructure while actively growing their communities. This includes running efficient nodes, processing network transactions, and managing delegator relationships. KOL Node operators serve as network ambassadors, driving adoption through their influence while ensuring technical performance meets network standards.

### How To Participate

2. Complete verification process
3. Meet minimum stake requirements

The network operates on a tiered rollout system, with KOL Nodes receiving priority after super nodes. This structured approach ensures network stability while rewarding early, committed participants.
