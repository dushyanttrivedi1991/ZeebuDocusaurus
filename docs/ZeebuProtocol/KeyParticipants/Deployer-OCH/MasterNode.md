<h2> Master Node </h2>

### What Is A Master Node?

A Master Node represents a cluster of 5 individual nodes in the Zeebu network, each requiring 200,000 ZBU stake. This high-capacity configuration processes larger volumes of telecom settlements, forming the highest tier of network infrastructure. Master Nodes require a total stake of 1,000,000 ZBU across their node cluster.

### Who Can Participate?

Master Nodes target institutional-grade participants: venture capital firms, hedge funds, and high-net-worth individuals. These operators must demonstrate substantial financial capacity, technical expertise, and long-term commitment to network operations. The significant stake requirement ensures serious, professional participation.

### Incentives

Master Node clusters earn maximum network rewards. Each node generates up to 45%+ APY through settlement processing. The multi-node structure multiplies earning potential across all five nodes. Operators receive both Gold Tier airdrops (50,000 ZBU per 200,000 ZBU staked) and Platinum Tier rewards (200,000 ZBU for 1,000,000 ZBU). Master Nodes maintain first priority in the network's node claiming process.

### Responsibilities

Operators manage comprehensive network infrastructure across their node cluster. This includes maintaining five separate nodes, processing high volumes of transactions, ensuring consistent uptime, and meeting stake requirements. Master Node operators serve as cornerstone participants, supporting network stability through professional operations.

### How To Participate

1. Contact Zeebu team through official channels
2. Complete institutional verification
3. Meet 1,000,000 ZBU total stake requirement
4. Deploy five-node infrastructure
5. Launch operational protocols

Master Nodes receive first priority in the network's structured rollout, preceding both KOL and Private Nodes.
