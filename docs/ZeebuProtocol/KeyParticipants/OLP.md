### DEXs and CEXs Pools

**You will need LP Tokens from the DEX Pools (BASE) which Zeebu Ecosystem supports**

### What is LP token:

LP tokens are digital assets you receive when you deposit your cryptocurrency into a liquidity pool on a decentralized exchange (DEX). These tokens represent your share of the pool and the rewards earned from transaction fees.

For example: If you add $100 worth of tokens to a liquidity pool, you get LP tokens in return. You can redeem them later to withdraw your share, along with any earned rewards. [Learn More..](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/what-are-liquidity-pool-lp-tokens)
