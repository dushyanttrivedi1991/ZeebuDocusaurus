<h2> Role Of Each Participants </h2>

### Delegators

- **Role**: Delegators are standard users who stake their ZBU tokens within the platform.

- **Process**: Upon staking ZBU, Delegators receive VeZBU tokens, which empower them with voting rights and influence within the ecosystem.

- **Rewards**: They earn daily rewards based on the amount of VeZBU staked and the activities performed by the Deployers they support.

### Deployers

- **Role**: Deployers act as infrastructure providers critical to the platform’s functionality.

- **Eligibility**: To become a Deployer, participants must stake a significant amount of ZBU tokens.

- **Function**: They use their staked VeZBU to deploy settlement smart contracts. These contracts manage the settlement processes, leveraging the staked VeZBU to allow for the settlement of invoices up to the value of the VeZBU held.

- **Rewards**: Deployers earn a 0.60% fee on each transaction they facilitate, incentivizing them to maintain and expand their operations.

### On-Demand Liquidity Providers(OLPs)

- **Role**: OLPs are liquidity providers who ensure that assets within the platform are sufficiently liquid.

- **Function**: They contribute to the liquidity pools, maintaining a specified ratio (typically 20-80 [ZBU-USDC]) to balance the pool. This ratio ensures that there is enough liquidity available for the settlement cycles they support.

- **Rewards**: OLPs earn a 0.40% reward on each settlement cycle that utilizes their provided liquidity, encouraging them to commit more resources to the platform.

### Merchants

- **Exploring available tasks**: Look through the range of tasks and see where your interests align. This could range from liquidity provision to participating in governance decisions.

- **Joining the community**: Become an active member of the community through forums, chat groups, and other social platforms. Sharing insights, asking questions, and offering support are great ways to contribute.

- **Taking part in governance**: As you grow within the platform, take the opportunity to voice your opinions and vote on proposals that shape the future direction of the ecosystem.

### Initial Participation

All users start with basic access to the ecosystem, allowing them to familiarize themselves with the platform’s functionalities and participate in initial activities. This introductory phase is crucial for understanding how the ZBU Protocol operates and where you can best contribute.

### Advanced Roles
