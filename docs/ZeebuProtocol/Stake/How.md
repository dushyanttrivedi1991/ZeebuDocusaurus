<h2> How </h2>

### Stake Tokens

If you're interested in competitive rewards in stablecoins from actively staking on the Zeebu Protocol, the Zeebu Protocol may be the opportunity you are looking for. Staking ZBU is an interestingly unique value proposition, given that rewards are paid out in stablecoins because they are generated from fees on their B2B PSP.

### Risks

If any person stakes to a Pre-Live node, and that node fails to become Live by not accruing the 200k minimum threshold ZBU staked, your liquidity will be pushed to a Live Node for yield and settlements to begin. This ensures and creates safety for any Pre-Live Node participant to feel safe with joining their community in delegation to their node without worrying about the liquidity sitting dormant and not earning yield derived from active participation in the protocol.

### Rewards

- Stablecoin Rewards (Deployers): Earn up to 45%+ APY rewards in stablecoins as a Deployer for providing settlement capacity and TPS to the network. 

### Benefits

1. **Flexible Staking Options**: Choose from various node operators or become one yourself, allowing you to tailor your involvement according to the competetitve APY given by node operators.

2. **Real-World Utility**: By staking ZBU, you're supporting a platform that's disrupting the traditional payments rails of the telecom industry. 

3. **Deflationary Token Economics**: Zeebu's burning mechanism creates deflationary pressure, decreasing the total available ZBU tokens on the market every quarter.

### Criteria

- Any persons with liquidity interested in long-term, real-world yield. 

- Whether you're a seasoned market participant looking for diversification or new to the space and seeking a stable entry point, staking ZBU offers a compelling opportunity to earn while actively participating in B2B telecoms settlements, outside of token emissions and market volatility.
