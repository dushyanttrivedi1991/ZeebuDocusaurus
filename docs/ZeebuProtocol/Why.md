<h2> Why? </h2>

### The Evolution of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has significantly reshaped the financial landscape by democratizing access to financial services. Traditionally dominated by centralized institutions, financial services have transitioned to a more inclusive model through blockchain technology. DeFi eliminates intermediaries such as banks and brokers, thereby reducing costs and increasing transaction speed. The adoption of smart contracts on blockchains like Ethereum has further facilitated complex financial operations directly between parties, fostering a new era of innovation in protocols offering lending, borrowing, trading, and risk management.

### Challenges in the Current DeFi Ecosystem

While DeFi continues to grow, several critical issues persist:

    - **Settlement Inefficiencies**: Many DeFi transactions suffer from slow processing times and high costs, especially during periods of network congestion.

    - **Liquidity Shortages**: Effective settlement of transactions, particularly large volumes, often requires substantial liquidity which can be scarce in decentralized environments.

    - **Centralization Risks**: Several prominent DeFi projects rely on centralized components to manage parts of their operations, creating potential security risks and points of failure.

    - **Limited Scalability**: Existing settlement solutions struggle to scale effectively with the increasing demand and complexity of DeFi applications.

These challenges compromise the efficiency, security, and scalability of DeFi services, hindering their potential to fully replace traditional financial systems.

### Why ZBU Protocol Was Needed?

The inception of ZBU Protocol was driven by the following necessities in the DeFi market:

    - **Enhancing Decentralization**: To uphold the core ethos of DeFi, reducing reliance on centralized components and intermediaries is crucial. ZBU Protocol fosters a fully decentralized network where all participants have equal potential to contribute and benefit.

    - **Optimizing Liquidity Utilization**: By structuring more efficient liquidity pools and incentivizing participants through rewards, ZBU Protocol ensures that sufficient liquidity is always available for settlement processes.

    - **Scalable and Flexible Settlements**: The protocol is designed to accommodate a high volume of transactions without compromising on speed or security, adapting to the needs of both small and large-scale DeFi projects.

    - **Bridging TradeFi and DeFi**: ZBU Protocol aims to create a seamless interface between traditional finance and decentralized finance, facilitating easier and more efficient integration of legacy financial assets into the blockchain ecosystem.
